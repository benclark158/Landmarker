# Landmarker3

This is the offical app folder for Landmarker3

## Function

The purpose of this app is to allow users to take photos of a given UK landmark. The app will then tell the user what the landmark is. More specifically the app is tarketed at University of Nottingham students.

The app will recognise any (dependant on training) building on a UoN campus (UK based). This will be used to help new and international students as well as visitors and open day guests to find their way around university, even if they cannot see the signs, or are approaching the building from an unknown angle.

## Integration

This app is intended to have cross-platform support, however, iOS support has not been tested yet. However, the app is fully tested using Android.

## How to run the app
